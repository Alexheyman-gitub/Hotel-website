        <p>The Boston Suites are aptly named due to their wonderful views beyond the hotel's fountain to the greenery. The generous proportions of these suites provide separate spacious and airy living and sleeping areas complete with walk-in closets and a marble bathroom with double sinks. Situated on the corners of the hotel, Beverly Suites have unparalleled views from the windows as well as generous balconies where guests can choose to dine or take in the sunshine. The sitting room is elegantly styled and flooded with natural light.</p>

        <p>Very historic. The staff is very, very friendly, helpful, and professional. I have been staying at this hotel for many years. I especially love the executive floor that has breakfast and happy hour food. But the front desk staff was the absolute best. I would 100% recommend this hotel. And Taylor Swift filmed her music video for her song Delicate\" here. So for me this is just an extra cool thing on top of how great this hotel already is to me. I really enjoyed every time I have been here."</p>
